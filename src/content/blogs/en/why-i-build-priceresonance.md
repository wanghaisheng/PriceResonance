I wanted to share something exciting that I've been working on. Since February, Iâ€™ve been navigating some tough personal challengesâ€”my parents were in and out of the hospital, and I lost my job in April. Itâ€™s been a rollercoaster, but I channeled that energy into a project Iâ€™m really passionate about.

As a self-taught programmer, I've spent countless hours diving into GitHub and exploring over 3,000 repositories. Despite all the research, it felt like nothing was quite coming together until recently. My latest project is a result of those trials and tribulations: **PriceResonance**.

**PriceResonance** is an AI-powered platform designed to help businesses track and optimize their competitors' pricing strategies. I realized how crucial price tracking is for staying competitive, so I set out to build a tool that leverages AI to make this process smarter and more efficient.

### The Journey Behind PriceResonance

The idea for PriceResonance emerged from my personal experiences and the challenges I faced while navigating the complexities of pricing strategies in the SaaS industry. During my time exploring GitHub, I encountered various tools and methodologies, but none seemed to fully address the dynamic nature of pricing in todayâ€™s market.

My goal was to create a solution that not only simplifies the process of price tracking but also enhances the decision-making capabilities of businesses. I wanted to build a platform that could adapt to the ever-changing landscape of pricing strategies, allowing companies to stay ahead of the competition.
